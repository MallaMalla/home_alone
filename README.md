 Mobile App Project

Flutter/Dart project.

The project is not finished, but there is already basics in the bottom.
Code needs more details and "making-sures", try-catches and stuff. But it is raw start.

The application will be for lonely people for securing every day. With a timer the alarm
pops every day at the same time, and unless ppl press "im ok" -button in some time, the application 
will send sms to defined phonenumber saying "pls check i am ok, i didnt answer my alarm". 
It will be good!
